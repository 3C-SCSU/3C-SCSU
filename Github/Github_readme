This is a WIP area for learning and practicing git actions. 

Each directory should contain a readme and solution for a different git operation. 

This section of the Wiki has more details and links to the official documentation: https://github.com/3C-SCSU/3C-SCSU/wiki/Github-Beginning-Guide

If you would like to be given collaborator access to the repository, contact 3C through email or discord. This is a work in progress and open to any contributions or feedback. 
The next upcoming practice areas to be completed are PR review, PR merge, and Merge Conflicts.
